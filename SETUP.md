1. The doc file contains the prototype of the website, which has been discussed with the teacher. It can be used as reference. 
   I program the system based on this prototype, but due to the time constraints, there are still many imperfections, and some bugs have not been fixed. I sincerely apologize for any issues.

2. Before running the application, please run the [init-db.sql] file first, to ensure that there is data for testing.

3. All dependencies need to be installed before start the app.

4. The database name and password are my student ID and my username.

5. Thanks for your time in testing and using this project.
